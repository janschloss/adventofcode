# Advent of Code

Here I document my journey through the Advent of Code (AoC) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that cover a wide range of skills and concepts. It's a great way to improve your coding abilities, learn new algorithms, and get into the festive spirit.

**Disclaimer:** The code in this repository is part of my learning journey with lower level languages, exploring new concepts and solving puzzles. It is not intended to represent production-grade code or best practices. In my professional work I deliver high quality code stemming from almost a decade of experience in the TypeScript ecosystem.

## Goal

The goal of this repository is not just to solve puzzles but to use this challenge as an opportunity to learn new programming languages and refine my problem-solving skills. Each year, AoC offers me a unique chance to step out of my comfort zone, experiment with languages I'm unfamiliar with, and understand their paradigms and idiosyncrasies.

## Contributing

While this project is primarily a personal learning journey, I'm open to suggestion and discussions from the community. Whether it's improving existing solutions or discussing problem-solving strategies, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Contact

If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to share your own AoC experiences, please feel free to contact me.
